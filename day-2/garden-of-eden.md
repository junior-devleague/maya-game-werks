## Lore

At the point in which the guardian realms converge, the Garden of Eden lies. It is in this paradise where the guardians may rest at their leisure. The Garden features beautiful plants and architecture. Trees, bushes and grasses cover these grounds. But something has gone very wrong. Why do I keep tripping on some of these tree roots?
