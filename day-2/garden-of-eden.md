## Lore

At the point in which the guardian realms converge, the Garden of Eden lies. It is in this paradise where the guardians may rest at their leisure. The Garden features beautiful plants and architecture. Trees, bushes and grasses cover these grounds. But something has gone very wrong. Why do I keep tripping on some of these tree roots?

## Gameplay

Dodge and avoid the evil plants. Strategically use tools around you to snip at or slap away harmful plants to get to the key. This key will allow you to unlock the doors to the boss level.
